## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps (Prioritized)

### 🔴 Priority 1: Critical (Before Course Delivery)

#### Option A: Functional Testing (HIGHEST PRIORITY) ⭐

**Status:** Not Started  
**Estimated Time:** 8-12 hours  
**Impact:** Prevents course delivery issues

**What to do:**
- Test all scripts in a non-production OCI environment
- Follow `TESTING_AND_VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md`
- Verify each script works end-to-end with actual OCI services
- Document and fix any issues found

**Why this is important:**
- Ensures scripts work correctly before students use them
- Identifies real-world issues early
- Builds confidence in the implementation

**Can start:** ✅ Ready - Checklist available in `TESTING_AND_VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md`

#### Option B: Create Quick Reference Guides 📋

**Status:** Not Started  
**Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours  
**Impact:** Saves time during course delivery

**What to create:**
- Quick command reference for all scripts
- Common OCI CLI commands cheat sheet
- Environment variable reference
- Copy-paste ready script examples
- Day-specific quick references

**Why this is valuable:**
- Helps instructors and students find commands quickly
- Reduces time spent searching documentation
- Improves course flow

**Can start:** ✅ Ready - Can create now

#### Option C: Create Instructor Notes 📝

**Status:** Not Started  
**Estimated Time:** 4-5 hours  
**Impact:** Enables smooth course delivery

**What to create:**
- Common student questions and answers
- Expected timing for each lab
- Common mistakes and how to fix them
- Troubleshooting tips for instructors
- Alternative approaches if something fails

**Why this is valuable:**
- Helps instructors prepare for delivery
- Reduces instructor stress during course
- Ensures consistent teaching quality

**Can start:** ✅ Ready - Can create now

### 🟡 Priority 2: Enhancement (Nice to Have)

#### Option D: Create Configuration Examples

**Status:** Not Started  
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours

**What to create:**
- Example `terraform.tfvars` files
- Example environment variable configurations
- Configuration value documentation

## 💡 My Recommendation

Based on the current status, I recommend:

### **Option 1: Functional Testing** (If you have OCI access)
- Most critical for course readiness
- Ensures everything works before students use it
- Can identify and fix issues early

### **Option 2: Quick Reference Guides** (If testing isn't possible yet)
- High value, relatively quick
- Can be done without OCI access
- Immediately useful for course delivery

### **Option 3: Instructor Notes** (Parallel work)
- Can be created alongside testing
- Valuable preparation for instructors
- Helps with course delivery quality
